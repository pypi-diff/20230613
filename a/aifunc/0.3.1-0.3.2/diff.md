       Evaluation: The answer captures some of the reference answer information but not entirely. The reference answer implies that performance contracts allow for detailed prediction and monitoring of NF (Network Functions), while the answer simply states that a performance contract characterizes NF performance. The details about "fine-grained prediction" and "scrutiny" aren't present in the answer.
       Presentation score: 15
       Evaluation: The presentation is mostly clear and coherent but could use more sophisticated language. Suggestion for improvement: Try to use more technical vocabulary related to the topic and ensure the sentences flow well with each other for better coherence.
       Suggested Answer: As the user's answer does not provide additional value, the suggested answer is the same as the reference answer: 'Performance contracts enable fine-grained prediction and scrutiny of NF.'

-      What is a performance contract?
-      Reference Answer: Performance contracts enable fine-grained prediction and scrutiny of NF.
-      Performance contracts allow for systematic observation and detailed analysis of NF performance, in addition to serving as a binding agreement.

-      Evaluation: The answer captures most of the reference answer information and adds additional valuable details about the nature of performance contracts. It could be improved by including the "fine-grained prediction" aspect mentioned in the reference answer.
-      Presentation score: 18
-      Evaluation: The presentation is clear, coherent, and uses appropriate language. Suggestion for improvement: Consider rephrasing "binding agreement" to something more specific and related to the topic, like "operational agreement in network functionality."
-      Suggested Answer: Performance contracts, allowing for systematic observation and detailed analysis, serve as an operational agreement in network functionality. They enable fine-grained prediction and scrutiny of NF.
       
   - prompt: |
       Can you explain the Vigor approach and how it verifies that NF code is memory-safe and satisfies semantic properties?
       Reference Answer: Vigor, which verifies that NF code written in C satisfies semantic properties and is memory-safe by assuming clear separation of NF code into a library of commonly used NF data structures, verified by experts, and stateless NF logic using the verified library and verified automatically using symbolic execution.
       I do not know.
